This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) to serve as a website for the Department of Clothing, Textiles, and Interior Design of UP Diliman. The website content is managed using Sanity. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# then run
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. 

The project includes basic website components such as:

- Header
- Footer
- Navigation Bar
- Web pages
- Schema for Content Modules

You can edit the page by modifying the respective `page.tsx` file in the 'app' folder and subfolders. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
